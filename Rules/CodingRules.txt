** Some coding rules **

Freely inspired from BitcoinJ / BitcoinSharp, some of the classes might be direct imports with little modifications;
However, implementations of algorithms must be much more clean and "bulletproof".
Basic operations (Sending BTC, being notified of incoming transactions, creation of a new address and reuse of private keys) must be *very* easy to handle.


* Bicoin is spelled Bitcoin, not BitCoin, as on http://bitcoin.org/

* *Always* add brackets, on the same line as the operation if single; This prevent mistakes to happen if someone want to add code to your block.
Incorrect:
if(condition)
	doIt();
Correct:
if(condition)
{ doIt(); }

* When relevant, prefer using abstract classes (you put in an "Abstractions" directory, along with Interfaces), that you prefix with an A; It's useful to add methods or logic afterwise
